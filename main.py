"""
Entry point for the ARD (Autonomous RL Designer) reward-refinement pipeline.

Stage 2 — Automated reward refinement (Eureka-style):
  1. An LLM proposes complete `_get_rewards` methods for an ard-isaaclab-tasks env.
  2. Each candidate is spliced into a fresh copy of the task repo (AST injection)
     and trained `repeats` times, each on its own seed, as docker jobs.
  3. Finished jobs are scored by the task's fixed `fitness_function` metric, and a
     candidate's fitness is the trimmed mean of its repeats (highest and lowest
     discarded), so one lucky training cannot win the batch. The top `survivors`
     candidates (pool + batch) become the next round's parents, each improved in
     its own conversation branch from its own training summary.
  4. After the search loop, the best candidate of the whole run is re-trained on
     `num_eval` seeds once, and reported as mean +/- std over those seeds.

Usage:
    export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...            # LLM key
    python main.py --refine                       # uses configs/taskconfig.yaml
    python main.py --refine --task cartpole        # by dir name; or --task Isaac-ARD-Humanoid-v0
    python main.py --refine --taskconfig configs/taskconfig.yaml \
                   --settings configs/settings.yaml --refineconfig configs/refineconfig.yaml
