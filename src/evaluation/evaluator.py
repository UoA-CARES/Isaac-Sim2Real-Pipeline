"""
Local evaluation orchestrator.

``RewardEvaluator`` is the high-level entry point ARD's refinement loop calls.
Its sole responsibility is **dispatch + capture** — running candidates and
collecting their output. For a batch of :class:`~src.reward_history.RewardRecord`
(each carrying a proposed ``compute_reward`` method) it walks them one at a time:

1. Builds the candidate's job codebase (pristine ard-isaaclab-tasks repo + the
   proposed reward spliced in) — :class:`WorkspaceManager`.
2. Builds + runs it on the local machine, blocking until it finishes —
   :class:`LocalRunner`.
3. Reads the run's logs in place (from its work dir) and captures its run paths +
   scalar summary — :class:`ResultProcessor`.

It writes job status and captured artifact paths back onto each record but does
**not** read fitness or pick a winner — that judgement is
:class:`~src.evaluation.scorer.FitnessScorer`'s job. This keeps the evaluator a
pure executor and leaves scoring a separate, swappable step.
