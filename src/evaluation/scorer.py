"""
Fitness judgement for evaluated reward candidates.

This is the "judge" half that was split out of the evaluator: given records the
evaluator has already trained and captured, it reads the fixed ``fitness_function``
metric from each one's TensorBoard log, writes it onto the record, and selects
the batch winner. The evaluator stays responsible only for dispatch + capture;
all metric reading and ranking lives here so the scoring policy can change
(e.g. mean-over-seeds, multi-objective) without touching dispatch.
