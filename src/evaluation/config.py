# Name of the method ARD rewrites in each task env file (the "sole edit target").
# It is NOT ``_get_rewards``: that stays a fixed framework hook which calls this
# method and publishes what it returns. ``compute_reward`` is the Eureka-style
# workspace, returning ``(total_reward, reward_components)``.
REWARD_METHOD_NAME = "compute_reward"

# The fixed evaluation metric the tasks log via
# ``self.extras["log"]["fitness_function"]``. Matched against the TensorBoard
# scalar tags by full tag or by final path segment, so the scope prefix the
# rl_games observer adds still resolves (e.g. "Episode/fitness_function").
FITNESS_METRIC = "fitness_function"

# Prefix the task layer puts on every reward scalar it logs (see
# ``ard_tasks.utils.reward_logging``): each component from the LLM's
# ``reward_components`` dict becomes ``Episode/components_<name>``, and the aggregate
# becomes ``Episode/components_total``. ARD uses this to pull the reward's own scalars
# out of the ~30 tags rl_games writes, and show them to the LLM first.
REWARD_SCALAR_PREFIX = "components_"

# The aggregate reward's scalar name (Eureka's ``gpt_reward``).

# What goes into the LLM feedback summary                                      #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# rl_games writes ~30 scalars per run. Most are optimiser internals the reward
# designer cannot act on (a_loss, c_loss, kl, e_clip, lr_mul, the whole
# performance/* group, and the /step and /time duplicates of metrics already
# reported per iteration). Pasting all of them into every feedback message spends
# context on noise and buries the reward's own components. Only the scalars below
# reach the summary.

# Everything the env logs through ``extras["log"]`` lands under this scope: the
# reward components, the aggregate, ``fitness_function``, ``consecutive_successes``,
# and any task-specific metric (e.g. the vision task's ``pose_loss``). All of it is
# kept — this is the reward designer's own instrumentation.
SUMMARY_TAG_SCOPE = "Episode/"

# The few rl_games-side scalars worth keeping, by exact tag:
#   episode_lengths/iter — how long episodes last, the clearest read on whether the
#                          policy is surviving longer or terminating earlier.
#   rewards/iter         — rl_games' own mean episode return, for comparison against
#                          ``Episode/components_total``.
#   losses/entropy       — policy entropy; a collapse means exploration stopped.
#   info/last_lr         — the adaptive LR, which moves when the KL schedule reacts.
# Names match rl_games' writer exactly (note ``episode_lengths``, plural).
