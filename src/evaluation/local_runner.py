"""
Single-machine job runner — build + run one reward candidate on this machine.

ARD's execution model is deliberately boring: for each candidate it builds the
submitted project's ``Dockerfile`` and ``docker run``s the image in a per-job
working directory, then reads the ``logs/`` the container wrote there. The
ard-isaaclab-tasks codebase is already packaged for exactly this (Dockerfile at
the repo root, env-driven ``scripts/pcs_entrypoint.sh``).

``LocalRunner`` is the only execution backend, and it exposes a single blocking
call the evaluator drives in a plain loop:

    healthz()      -> docker reachable?
    run(...)       -> build the image, run the container, return a RunResult

There is no job queue, no submit/wait split, and no artifacts tarball: the run
mounts the job's ``work_dir`` at ``/work``, the container writes ``logs/`` there,
and the evaluator reads those logs in place (:class:`ResultProcessor`). Codebase
staging (:class:`WorkspaceManager`) and scoring stay independent of how jobs run.

Container contract:
  * the project tarball (Dockerfile at root) is the ``docker build`` context, so
    the candidate's injected ``compute_reward`` is baked into the image per job;
  * the container runs non-root (``-u $(id -u):$(id -g)``) with ``HOME`` and the
    working dir pointed at the per-job mount, into which ``logs/`` is written;
  * task/seed/tunables are passed through the job ``env`` (the image entrypoint
    reads ``TASK``/``SEED``/…), not a baked-in command.

``use_gpu`` attaches the whole local GPU (``--gpus all``); otherwise the job runs
CPU-only. There is no fractional-GPU request — one candidate runs at a time.
