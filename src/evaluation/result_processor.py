"""
Artifact capture for local training jobs.

Each finished job leaves its ``logs/`` tree in its own ``work_dir`` (the ``/work``
mount), produced by ``scripts/train.py`` (rl_games), i.e.
``logs/rl_games/<config>/<run>/summaries/events.out.tfevents.*`` plus params and
checkpoints. This module's job is strictly **capture**: locate the TensorBoard
event file under that dir and write a human-readable scalar summary (used as LLM
feedback). Nothing is packed or unpacked — the logs are read where they landed.

The summary is a *selection*, not a dump: only the env's own ``Episode/`` scalars
(reward components, the aggregate, the fitness metric) and a short allowlist of
rl_games training scalars are reported. See :meth:`ResultProcessor.group_tags`.

It deliberately does **not** read the fitness metric or pick a winner — that
judgement lives in :mod:`src.evaluation.scorer`. Keeping capture and judgement
apart lets the evaluator be responsible only for "run it and collect the
output", while scoring is a separate, swappable step.

        rl_games writes two kinds of file here: periodic ``last_<name>_ep_<N>_
        rew_<R>.pth`` snapshots (including a final one when training ends), and
        a single plain ``<name>.pth`` that it only overwrites when a *new* best
        reward is reached (once training has run past ``save_best_after`` in the
        task's ``rl_games_ppo_cfg.yaml``).

        ``mode`` picks between them:

        * ``best`` — the plain best-reward file. Training reward isn't
          monotonic, so the final periodic snapshot can score worse than an
          earlier peak. A run too short to ever clear ``save_best_after`` won't
          have this file, so fall back to the newest periodic snapshot.
        * ``latest`` — the newest periodic snapshot, i.e. the state training
          actually ended in, whatever its reward. Restricted to ``last_*``
          files so it never silently returns the best-reward file (which is the
          newest file on disk whenever the last new best landed at the end of
          training); falls back to the newest of everything if a run has no
          periodic snapshots.

        TODO: ``best`` defers to rl_games' own notion of best, which is scored
        on **raw training reward** — a questionable basis for warm-starting on
        two counts. (1) The LLM rewrites the reward function every iteration,
        so reward scale is not comparable across iterations: "best reward"
        measures something different each round. (2) Reward is not
        ``fitness_function``, the ground-truth objective ARD actually ranks
        candidates by, so the highest-reward epoch need not be the
        highest-fitness one. The real fix is a fitness-based save trigger in
        the rl_games fork — see docs/FITNESS_BASED_CHECKPOINT_GUIDE.md. Until
        then ``latest`` exists so the two policies can be compared empirically.
