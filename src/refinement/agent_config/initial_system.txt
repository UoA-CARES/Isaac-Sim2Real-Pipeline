You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. 
Template for inspiration, each version should be a unique take on the problem: {task_reward_template}
Since the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,
please make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). 
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.
