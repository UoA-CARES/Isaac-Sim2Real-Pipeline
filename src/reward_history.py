"""
Centralised, thread-safe record of the reward-refinement lifecycle.

One :class:`RewardRecord` captures the *entire* life of a single reward
candidate — from the LLM that proposed it, through the job that trained it, to
the fitness it scored and the feedback we sent back. :class:`RewardHistory` is
the one place that owns these records across every iteration and phase.

Why this exists
---------------
The loop used to scatter a candidate across positionally-aligned lists
(``reward_methods[i]`` / ``raw_responses[i]``), an idx-keyed ``logs`` list, and
a ``best_run`` dict. Correlating "which raw LLM response produced job X with
fitness Y, and what feedback did we send?" meant cross-referencing four
structures linked only by list position. A record collapses that into one
object that flows through generation -> evaluation -> judgement.

Concurrency
-----------
Reward generation is fanned out across a thread pool, so several threads
register records at once. Every mutation of the shared list goes through a
lock, so :meth:`RewardHistory.new_record` / :meth:`update` / reads are safe to
call concurrently. Per-record fields are otherwise written by the single-
threaded evaluate/score phases, which hold the record object directly.

Designed for a future where *all* candidates (not just the best) are fed back
to the LLM: every candidate is retained with its method, summary and fitness,
so :meth:`RewardHistory.for_iteration` already yields the full batch.
