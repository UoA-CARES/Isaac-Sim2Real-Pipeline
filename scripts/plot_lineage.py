"""
Draw the genealogy of every seed run: which candidate came from which parent.

Every run of `main.py` writes one `reward_history.json` under
`<runs-dir>/seed_<n>/<task>/`. A `run` record is one reward candidate and carries
`parent_tag` -- the survivor whose conversation branch it was generated from.
Those links form a forest: iteration 1 has no parents (10 roots),
and every later candidate hangs off one earlier candidate. A parent can keep
producing children for many iterations, because survivors stay in the pool and
compete against their own children (see `select_top_k` in src/evaluation/scorer.py),
so an edge may span several iterations.

A candidate is not one training any more. It is trained `repeats` times, each on
its own RL seed, and those trainings are stored as separate `trial` records that
are *not* nodes of the genealogy: they have no `parent_tag` and no children, and
this script skips them. What ranks the candidate is the IQM of its trials -- the
interquartile mean, i.e. throw away the highest and the lowest score and average
what is left, so at the default `repeats: 3` it is the middle training (see
`aggregate_trials` in src/evaluation/scorer.py). Every one of those scores is
kept in `trial_fitnesses`, and both figures show them next to the aggregate, so
a candidate that only looks good because one seed got lucky is visible as such.

Every seed is drawn on one shared fitness scale (same y range, same colour
ramp, same marker sizes), built from all the seeds that were loaded. A seed
whose best candidate is weak therefore peaks lower on the page and stays paler
than a strong one, instead of each figure being rescaled to its own best.

Two figures are written:

  lineage_fitness.png       One panel per seed. x = iteration, y = fitness (log),
                            one dot per candidate at its IQM, a pale bar through
                            it spanning that candidate's repeats (one tick per
                            training), and a line from each parent to each of
                            its children. Blue dots produced at least one child
                            (they were survivors); grey dots are dead ends; the
                            orange path is the ancestry of the run's best
                            candidate. Candidates whose every repeat failed
                            (`fitness: null`) sit on the dashed floor line as
                            grey crosses.

  lineage_tree_seed_<n>.png One file per seed. The same forest as a plain family
                            tree: one row per candidate, indented by iteration,
                            elbow connectors from parent to child. Node colour and
                            size are the fitness (light/small = low, dark/big =
                            high), on the shared scale, and the bracket after
                            each label lists that candidate's repeats. This is
                            the figure to read when the question is purely "who
                            is whose child".
